<!-- Inline block for "section" above means that the 1st "section" in this "div" is going to stay side by side with the 2nd "section" in this "div", notice that the inputs
for this "div" were classed and then given the "block" value while the "input" below wasn't classed. This ensures that the inputs here (for "E&P") go to the next "line" in both
cases -->

    <section>
    <label for="email or phone">

<!-- Inline block for "section" above means that the 1st "section" in this "div" is going to stay side by side with the 2nd "section" in this "div" notice that the inputs
for the above "div" were classed and then given the "block" value while the "input" here wasn't classed. this ensures that the "input" here (for checkbox) stays right next to "keep me
me logged in" instead of going to "a" new "line" as you'll see for the inputs above -->
